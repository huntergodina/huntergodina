### If you've got more time:
Hi! My name is Hunter Godina, and I am a software engineer 💻 by trade and Chicago Bears fan 🏈 by nature. Chances are, if you're finding me on social media, you're already aware of one of those two, but I invite you to learn more about the other! I've known that I had a passion for problem-solving since I was young. In fact, I had planned on studying math 🧮 long before I had any idea about computers! But once I had the opportunity to explore software engineering, it was clear that I had to find the overlap between the two.

Now, I enjoy building out solutions for complex technical problems, and trying to find ways to apply technology to real-world issues 🌎 in my community! Most recently, I had the pleasure of building out a couple of applications that spurred some incredible fundraising for Childrens' Hospital of Omaha, which you should checkout below! These two lightweight applications were a blast to hack together.

If you want to know about some of the other stuff I enjoy working on, feel free to reach out to me! I am always interested in discussing my recent coding projects, my true passion (the Chicago Bears 🐻⬇️), or anything career related.
